    <h1>Why Sanitation and Hygiene Matter for Rural Development</h1>
  </div>

    <p>Access to clean water and proper sanitation is fundamental to human dignity, health, and economic progress. Yet, in many rural areas of India, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices pose serious threats to public health and development. Addressing these challenges is not just about building toilets—it is about creating sustainable systems that empower communities and ensure long-term well-being.</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      <p>“Sanitation is not just a facility; it is a gateway to education, gender equality, and community prosperity.”</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Impact of Poor Sanitation on Rural Communities</h2>
    <p>Lack of proper sanitation facilities leads to the spread of diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid, which are among the leading causes of child mortality in rural India. Open defecation contaminates water sources, pollutes the environment, and increases the risk of infections. Women and girls are particularly affected, as inadequate sanitation facilities compromise their safety, privacy, and dignity.</p>

    <h2>Sanitation and Its Role in Economic Growth</h2>
    <p>Poor sanitation is not just a health crisis—it is an economic burden. Communities with inadequate hygiene infrastructure experience lower productivity, increased medical expenses, and higher absenteeism in schools and workplaces. Studies have shown that improving sanitation can significantly boost economic growth by reducing healthcare costs and enhancing the quality of life.</p>

    <h2>Building Sustainable Sanitation Solutions</h2>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Behavioral Change Campaigns:</strong> Educating communities on handwashing, waste management, and hygiene practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS):</strong> Encouraging local participation in designing and maintaining sanitation systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Constructing eco-friendly toilets, ensuring clean water access, and improving drainage systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Women’s Empowerment Initiatives:</strong> Providing menstrual hygiene education and access to sanitary products to improve health outcomes for women and girls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Link Between Hygiene and Gender Equality</h2>
    <p>For women and girls, sanitation is more than just a convenience—it is a crucial factor in education and empowerment. Schools without proper toilets often see high dropout rates among girls, especially during menstruation. Ensuring clean and safe sanitation facilities in schools and public places helps promote gender equality by enabling women to participate fully in education and economic activities.</p>

    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li>Support sanitation programs through donations or volunteering.</li>
      <li>Advocate for policy changes to prioritize rural sanitation projects.</li>
      <li>Raise awareness about the importance of hygiene and sustainable sanitation practices.</li>
    </ul>
